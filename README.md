# -TextDetection_Images.
Programming artificial neural networks from scratch, using the knowledge acquired during the course of AI about linear models, nonlinear systems (activation function), loss functions and backpropagation. This program, after being trained, could identify the letter written on an image, regardless of the calligraphy used, the font, or the person who wrote it.
